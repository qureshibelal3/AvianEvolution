# AvianEvolutionCytochromeB
Bionformatics final project

## Overview
This project explores the evolutionary relationships among different bird species based on the Cytochrome b gene.

## Progress
- **Data Collection:** Collected Cytochrome b gene sequences for various bird species.
- **Alignment:** Used `mafft` for aligning the sequences.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:** Utilized the `ape` package in R to construct a family tree.

## Scripts
- `download_data.sh`: Script to download Cytochrome b gene sequences.
- `alignment_script.py`: Python script for sequence alignment.
- `phylogenetic_tree.R`: R script for constructing the phylogenetic tree.

## Dataset Commands
- To download Cytochrome b gene sequences: `./download_data.sh`
